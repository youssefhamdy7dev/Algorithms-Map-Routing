# Algorithms-MapRouting
Problem Definition The goal is to implement the classic Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm and optimize it for maps. Your goal is to reduce the amount of work involved per shortest path computation, without using excessive space. IDEA IMPLEMENTER FOR OPTIMIZATION IS: The naive implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm examines all V vertices in the graph. An obvious strategy to reduce the number of vertices examined is to stop the search as soon as you discover the shortest path to the destination. With this approach, you can make the running time per shortest path query proportional to E' log V' where E' and V' are the number of edges and vertices examined by Dijkstra's algorithm. However, this requires some care because just re-initializing all of the distances to âˆž would take time proportional to V. Since you are doing repeated queries, you can speed things up dramatically by only re-initializing those values that changed in the previous query.
